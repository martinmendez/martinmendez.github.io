Hi !, I am Martin Mendez. I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This is my github blog. I post here quotes, videos & podcasts and pictures. I am a CIO, so topics here are focused in the relationship between people and Information Technology (the soft side of IT).
In this place I primarily write in English.
I hope you enjoy your visit. I also have a blog at http://martinmendez.com where I used to publish longest thoughts (but I write in Spanish there)...
